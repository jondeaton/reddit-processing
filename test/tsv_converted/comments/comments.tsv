So when I thought of having sex with men I'd desire for me to have a vagina and them to penetrate me like that. So for a while I just thought being trans was just a side thing of my being Bi. Whenever I look back at numerous signs I have no idea how I didn't figure out I was trans earlier.	t1_d98t7tv	t3_59gf1u
