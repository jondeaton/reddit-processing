Hello I'm Josh and I love to make you laugh with my funny self-deprecating humor (although self-deprecation is the highest form of humor). I'm very open-minded and non-judgmental so please don't be shy and come alone to my journey of eating pizza while I tell you how was your day. I would also say Im charming, as I don't think girls realize how handsome my mom says I am. I also take fitness serious. I love building some muscle and taking care of my body.\nThis is me: http://imgur.com/a/7Rz6j\nI'm looking for someone who wants a serious relationship and willing to have a long distance relationship. Someone who I can be my goofy self, as well as a good personality, funny, loyal and kind. We dont have to like similar things but share similar values.\nI can also be clingy due to past relationship, but that's just mean i have a big heart, but I dont regret those relationship as at the end of the day I was just being myself and that's good enough for me.\nI have skype, discord or whatever you want me to be on. If I grab your attention send me a message. Bye"
